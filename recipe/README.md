# `conda-forge` Repodata Patching

## What is a repodata patch?

Sometimes, already published conda packages contain metadata errors (which can be repaired without needing to rebuild
the packages). Most commonly, package dependencies are incorrect, but the package artifacts themselves
are fine. A repodata patch specifies which packages are contain errors and how the package
should be modified to fix the error.

The best way to make a new patch is to use the patch YAML specification below. Custom patches
in python can be put into the `gen_patch_json.py` file.

## Repodata patch YAML specification

The files in this directory are used to construct repodata patches for conda-forge.
Typically, a single feedstock will have a single YAML file specifying the patches
for the packages produced by that feedstock. Use comments liberally to describe
why the patch exists.

Patches are specified by two main blocks.

- The `if` block specifies a set of conditions under which the changes in the `then` block are applied.
- The different conditions in the `if` block are combined with a logical `AND`.
- Any condition may be prefixed by `not_` and will be negated.
- The `if` conditions can use shell glob syntax as implemented in the python `fnmatch` module in the
  standard library. The optional "?( *)" pattern from extended glob syntax is allowed to match zero or
  one sequences of spaces plus any other characters.
- The `then` section uses the Python `string.Template` system to allow the `version`, `build_number`, `name`, or
  `subdir` values to be inserted into strings via templates (e.g., `"blah <=${version}"`) at runtime.
- Multiple patches can be in the same file using separate YAML documents (i.e., separate the data by `---`
  on a new line).

```yaml
if:
  # possible conditions
  # list of subdirs or a single subdir (e.g., "linux-64")
  subdir_in: linux-64
  # any subdir but linux-64
  not_subdir_in: linux-64

  # list of artifact names or a single name (e.g., "ngmix-2.3.0-py38h50d1736_1.conda")
  artifact_in: ngmix-2.3.0-py38h50d1736_1.conda

  # any key in the repodata entry (e.g., "version" or "build_number") with an operation
  <repodata key>_<ge, gt, le, lt>: <value>
  # this means version > 1.0.0
  version_gt: 1.0.0
  # keeps any record with timestamp < value
  # you can generate the current time via
  #  python -c "import time; print(f'{time.time():.0f}000')"
  timestamp_lt: 1633470721000

  # any key in the repodata entry (e.g., "version" or "build_number") and a list of values or single value
  <repodata key>_in: <list or single item>

  # this means the build number is in the set {0, 1, 2}
  build_number_in: [0, 1, 2]

  # has specific dependencies as either a list or a single string
  has_depends: numpy*  # matches 'numpy', 'nump-blah', or 'numpy 5.6'
  has_depends: numpy?( *)  # matches 'numpy' or 'numpy 5.6' but not 'numpy-blah'
  has_depends: numpy  # matches "numpy" exactly (i.e., no pins)

  # has specific constraints as either a list or a single key
  has_constrains: numpy*  # matches 'numpy', 'nump-blah', or 'numpy 5.6'
  has_constrains: numpy?( *)  # matches 'numpy' or 'numpy 5.6' but not 'numpy-blah'
  has_constrains: numpy  # matches "numpy" exactly (i.e., no pins)

  # single value for a key that should match
  <repodata key>: <value>
  version: 1.0.0

      max_pin: 'x.x'

> [!WARNING]
> The condition `timestamp_lt` is required to prevent your patch from modifying

## Testing New Patches using `show_diff.py`

> [!TIP]
> You can install a development environment for testing your repodata patch
> using the environment file `dev-env-for-patches.yaml`

The `show_diff.py` script in this directory can be used to test out
modifications to `gen_patch_json.py`.  This scripts shows the difference
between the package records currently available on anaconda.org/conda-forge and those
produced from the patch instructions produced by `gen_patch_json.py`.

Usage is:

```bash
usage: show_diff.py [-h] [--subdirs [SUBDIRS [SUBDIRS ...]]] [--use-cache]

show repodata changes from the current gen_patch_json

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --subdirs [SUBDIRS [SUBDIRS ...]]
                        subdir(s) show, default is all
  --use-cache           use cached repodata files, rather than downloading
                        them

```

Repodata is cached in a `cache` directory in the current directory or in the
path specified by the `CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

Typically, `show_diff.py` is run without any argument to download the
necessary repodata followed by repeated calls to `show_diff.py --use-cache`
to test out changes to the `gen_patch_json.py` script.

> [!TIP]
> If you're having trouble running `show_diff.py` locally, don't despair. You
> should still submit your patch. The Azure job also returns this information.
> Search the build log for `patching repodata:` and copy-paste the output for
> all the architectures to your Pull Request. Stop copying once you've reached
> `patching repodata: 100%`

## Patch JSON Format for `anaconda.org`

This scheme generates one file per subdir, ``patch_instructions.json``.  This file has entries

```json
instructions = {
        "patch_instructions_version": 1,
        "packages": defaultdict(dict),
        "revoke": [],
        "remove": [],
    }
```

`remove` are lists of filenames that will not show up in the index but may still be downloadable with a direct URL to the file.

`packages` is a dictionary, where keys are package filenames.  Values are dictionaries similar to the contents of each package in `repodata.json`.  Any values provided in ``packages`` here overwrite the values in `repodata.json`.  Any value set to None is removed.

A tool downloads this package when it sees updates to it, and applies the `patch_instructions.json`
to the repodata of the `conda-forge` channel on anaconda.org

## Deployment of patches to `anaconda.org`

After a patch PR is merged there are no further actions for patch submitters, feedstock maintainers, or conda-forge to take.
Anaconda, Inc. manages the infrastructure that applies patches from this repository to the repodata of distributions on [anaconda.org/conda-forge/](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/).
This infrastructure is related to the process for updating their CDN, so patches should generally be applied and usable within a few hours after a patch PR is merged.
