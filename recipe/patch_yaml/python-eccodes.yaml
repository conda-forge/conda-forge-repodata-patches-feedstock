# Version 1.6.0 of python-eccodes links against a function that was added to eccodes
# only in version 2.31.0. The declaration in the upstream package was not updated,
# which is why this slipped by. Build numbers 1+ contain the right lower limit,
# but build number 0 needs to be patched to avoid runtime linking problems.
# For details, see https://github.com/conda-forge/python-eccodes-feedstock/issues/86.
