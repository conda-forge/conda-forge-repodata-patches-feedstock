# https://github.com/conda-forge/hatchling-feedstock has broken metadata for
# the minimum Python version required from v1.18.0 onwards (currently v1.25.0).
# The last version of hatchling that was compatible with Python 3.7 was v1.17.1
# as after that https://github.com/pypa/hatch/pull/1386 introduced Python 3.8+
# syntax that made its way into hatchling v1.23.0 onward, though hatchling v1.18.0
# was the first version to require Python 3.8+
# (c.f. https://github.com/pypa/hatch/releases/tag/hatchling-v1.18.0).
# c.f. https://github.com/conda-forge/pyhf-feedstock/pull/28#issuecomment-2464060369
#
# This is getting patched for hatchling v1.25.0 (rebuild) and future versions
# in https://github.com/conda-forge/hatchling-feedstock/pull/59, so only apply this
# python replacement patch for releases created prior to now (1731056098000
# which in human readable metadata is on 2024-11-08.)
