# pytest-split version 0.10.0 added a <9.0.0 upper bound for pytest.
# Now that pytest 9 has been released, the solver tries to downgrade
# pytest-split to 0.8.2, often causing breakage.

# Hopefully <https://github.com/jerry-git/pytest-split/issues/114>
# gets merged soon, and modern pytest-split will officially support
# pytest 9.
