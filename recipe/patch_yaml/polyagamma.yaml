# 2026/01 -- NumPy 2.4.0 is broken, and polyagamma triggers the breakage.
# Primary reference: <https://github.com/zoj613/polyagamma/issues/132>
# Summary: NumPy 2.4.0 broke the Cython random API ABI, and consequently
# polyagamma fails to import. A fix is pending in NumPy 2.4.1.
# We forbid NumPy 2.4.0 for current (=2.0.2) and previous versions
# of polyagamma.
if:
  name: polyagamma
