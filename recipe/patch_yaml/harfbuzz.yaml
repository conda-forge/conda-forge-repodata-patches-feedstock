# Harfbuzz declares that it will always maintain ABI compatibility for ever.
# https://github.com/conda-forge/harfbuzz-feedstock/issues/123
# We loosened the pinning for harfbuzz packages built after 11.0.1 in 2025,
# but here we loosen the packages built with all the way back to 8.1.0
# Which was released in 2023/08/25 on conda-forge (seems far back enough)
