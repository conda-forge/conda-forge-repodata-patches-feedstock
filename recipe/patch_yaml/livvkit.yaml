# livvkit v3.2.0 introduced new dependencies on nodejs and rumel.yaml, as well as a new minimum bound on pandas.
# The feedstock PR was merged without catching these dependencies changes, but was fixed for build number 1:
# https://github.com/conda-forge/livvkit-feedstock/pull/8
# This patch is to fix build number 0.
