# Before September 2023, metis had run_exports with max_pin x.x
# However, it turns out that metis 5.1.1 had ABI breakage w.r.t.
# to metis 5.1.0, so here we correct the run_dependency of
# packages that depends on metis, see:
# * https://github.com/conda-forge/metis-feedstock/pull/38
if:
  has_depends: metis >=5.1.*
  timestamp_lt: 1693402455000
then:
  - tighten_depends:
      name: metis
      max_pin: x.x.x
