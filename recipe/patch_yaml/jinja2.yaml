# patch for markupsafe appears here since closely related to jinja2 one
# To complement the above, markupsafe introduced a run constraint to
# only accept jinja2>=3 with markupsafe >=2.1. However, this constraint
# is missing from the build 0 of markupsafe 2.1.0 so one could still
# install markupsafe 2.1.0 from conda-forge and jinja2 from defaults.
# We add that run constraint to the build that was missing it.
