# Changes in openff-units 0.3.0 (an update for Pint 0.24 and enabling caching in Pint)
# causes an unforseen interaction with openff-toolkit <0.16.8


# The root issue here is that a change in openff-units 0.3.0 [1]
# introduced a somewhat hard to trigger bug[2], and a change [3]
# that went into openff-toolkit 0.16.8 avoids triggering it.
# However, openff-toolkit 0.16.7 and earlier trigger the bug, so
# this metadata patch aims to keep those earlier versions of
# openff-toolkit from being installed with openff-units 0.3.0
