# azure-core-cpp 1.11.0 broke tiledb
# https://github.com/conda-forge/tiledb-feedstock/issues/228
#
# azure-core-cpp minor releases are documented as backwards compatible, but
# clearly are not. Future azure-core-cpp conda binaries will have run exports
# with max_pin="x.x" to prevent future problems
