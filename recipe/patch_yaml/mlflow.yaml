# MLflow < 2.10.2 has databricks-cli as a dependency. The old databricks-cli
# (https://github.com/databricks/databricks-cli) has been replaced with a new
# Databricks CLI (https://github.com/databricks/cli) in conda-forge as of
# https://github.com/conda-forge/databricks-cli-feedstock/pull/29. The new
# Databricks CLI does not include a Python SDK, and so is incompatible with
# MLflow < 2.10.2. Add an upper bound pin to exclude the new Databricks CLI.
