# from this bit of code
# Old versions of arosics do not work with py-tools-ds>=0.16.0 due to the an import of the
# py-tools-ds.similarity module which was removed in py-tools-ds 0.16.0. In arosics>=1.2.0,
# this import does not exist anymore, i.e., newer versions of arosics work together with all
# py-tools-ds>=0.14.28 /0.15.8 / 0.15.10 versions as defined below.
# No additional PR in the arosics feedstock is needed.
