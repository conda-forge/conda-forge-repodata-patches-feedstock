# from this bit of code
# spacy-models-* needs to match spacy's maj.minor version, but old builds don't
# have that constraint correctly, leading to them being pulled in when a new
# spacy version releases, but before spacy-models-* is built in c-f, see
# https://github.com/conda-forge/spacy-models-feedstock/issues/5
# if (
#     record_name.startswith("spacy-model")
#     and record["version"].split(".")[0] < "3"
#     and subdir == "noarch"
#     and record.get('timestamp', 0) < 1675431752816
# ):
#     # to limit breakage of old environments that worked regardless of the wrong
#     # constraints, just ensure we don't get new spacy for old spacy-model-* builds
#     record['depends'].append("spacy <3")
